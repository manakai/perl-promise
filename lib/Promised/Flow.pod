Promised::Flow - Promise-aware basic control flows

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Promised::Flow;
  my $http = ...;
  return promised_cleanup {
    return $http->close;
  } promised_for {
    my $item = $_[0];
    return Promise->resolve->then (sub {
      return promised_timeout {
        return $http->get (q<https://example.com/> . $item);
      } 2;
    })->then (sub {
      return promised_sleep (0.5);
    });
  } [1, 2, 3, 4];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Promised::Flow> module exports a number of functions which
supports commonly-used patterns of promise-based programming.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

Following functions are exported by default:

=over 4

=item $promise = promised_for { ... } [$item, $item, ...]

With a code block and an array reference, run the code for each item
in the array, in order.  The code can return a promise.  The next
iteration is run after the promise of the previous iteration is
resolved.

It returns a promise which is resolved after the last iteration is
done.

If an iteration fails, the returned promise is rejected.  Any
remaining iteration is skipped.

=item $promise = promised_map { ... } [$item, $item, ...]

With a code block and an array reference, run the code for each item
in the array, in order, and create a new array reference with the
results of the code executions.  The code can return a promise which
is to be resolved with the result.  The next iteration is run after
the promise of the previous iteration is resolved.

It returns a promise which is resolved with the new array reference
after the last iteration is done.

If an iteration fails, the returned promise is rejected.  Any
remaining iteration is skipped.

=item $promise = promised_wait_until { ... } NAME => VALUE, ...

With a code block and optional options specified as name/value pairs,
run the code repeatedly until the code resolved with a true value.
The code can return a promise.

It returns a promise which is resolved after the resolution of the
code with a true value.

If the C<interval> option is specified, it is interpreted as a number
of seconds (which does not have to be an integer) of interval between
invocations of codes.  The default is C<1> (second).

If the C<timeout> option is specified, the returned promise is
rejected when the code never resolved with a true value within the
number of seconds specified by the option (which does not have to be
an integer).  Please note that any execution of the code at the time
of timeout is not terminated.  The default is no timeout.

=item $promise = promised_sleep ($seconds)

Return a promise which is resolved after a time interval.  The
argument must be a number in seconds, representing the interval.  The
number does not have to be an integer.

=item $promise = promised_timeout { ... } $seconds

With a code block and a number in seconds, run a code with timeout.
It returns a promise, which is resolved with the code's resolved value
(note that the code can return a promise), if the code is resolved
within the seconds of the timeout, or rejected otherwise.  The number
does not have to be an integer.

Please note that the running code is not terminated after the timeout.

If the timeout is C<undef>, no timeout is set.

=item $promise = promised_cleanup { ... } $promise

With a code block and promise, run the code just after the promise is
resolved or rejected.  The code can return a promise.  This can be
used to finally run a cleanup code after the main operations.

It returns a promise.  If both the input promise and the code are
resolved, the returned promise is resolved with the intput promise's
resolved value.  Otherwise, if both the input promies and the code are
rejected, the returned promise is rejected with the code's rejected
value.  Otherwise, the returned promise is rejected with the input
promise's or the code's rejected value.
